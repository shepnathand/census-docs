This website documents resources, best-practices, and obstacles pertaining to the US Census API.

### What is an API?
An **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface is a simple way to access/query data directly from the host's servers.

### Why use the Census API?
The Census API is useful for integrating census data into your website or for requesting a lot of data at once. Here are some examples of how others have used the Census API:

  + [ClearGov: Local Government Transparency & Analytics](http://www.cleargov.com/)
  + [Cornell: Poverty Map](http://pad.human.cornell.edu/Unlisted/uncertaintymap_fullinfo_api_B17001.cfm)
  + [Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council](https://geomap.ffiec.gov/FFIECGeocMap/GeocodeMap1.aspx)
  + [MABLE/Geocorr](http://mcdc.missouri.edu/websas/geocorr_index.shtml)
  + [Missouriâ€™s Office of Social and Economic Data Analysis](http://www.oseda.missouri.edu/)
  + [The New Yorker: Inequality and New York's Subway](http://projects.newyorker.com/story/subway/)
  + [University of Michigan](http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/dis/data/resource/detail/1457)
  + [U.S. Census Beureau: My Congressional District](https://www.census.gov/mycd/)[Circular Area Profiling System](http://mcdc.missouri.edu/websas/capsindex.shtml)

### Getting Started
The [Census API Documentation](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/guidance/api-user-guide.What_is_the_API.html) is a good place to start. There's a lot of material to go through; but, it's important to make sure you are getting the data you actually want.

Also, if you think you might make more than 500 requests per day, you are going to need an [API key](http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).

### What's Next?
Where you go after reading the API Documentation and getting an API Key depends on how you intend to use the data. Here are some places you might want to check out:

  + [Available API's: Find the data you want.](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html)
  + [Request Builder: Help building a request.](/request-builder/)
  + [API Wrapers: Some clean ways to download the data.](/wrapers/)
  + [Mapping: Tutorials on creating maps with ACS data.](/mapping/)
  + [Website Integration: How to integrate data from the API into your website.](/web-integration/)
